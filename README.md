# Belly Button Biodiversity

  The purpose of this project was to analyze and visualize bacterial data from volunteers who participated in a scientifc data inquiry. Volunteers are able to visit this browser dashboard to see if their bellybuttons contain bacterial species that are capable of manufacturing synthetic beef. The data was processed using Java Script and formatted with HTML.
